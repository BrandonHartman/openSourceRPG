A couple of years ago, I wanted to dive into the depths of C#. I wondered around on the internet that lead to Scott Lilly's 
open source rpg. His tutorial's lead me into developing in C#. This brings back how much fun I had learning C# during this
time period. It excites me to see how much developement I have had since my first couple projects. I'm excited to to 
continue to code and to see where the developement takes me!
